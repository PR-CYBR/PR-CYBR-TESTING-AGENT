# PR-CYBR-TESTING-AGENT Repository Structure Report (A-06)

## Current Architecture Snapshot
- The testing agent safeguards reliability across the broader PR-CYBR ecosystem by validating functionality, performance, and integrations, positioning testing as a cross-cutting service layer for other agents.[^readme-overview]
- Runtime orchestration is currently minimal: `src/main.py` instantiates `AgentCore` and delegates execution to its `run` method, which presently prints a heartbeat message.[^runtime]
- Shared utilities exist as a stubbed helper module under `src/shared/utils.py`, signaling intent to centralize reusable helpers as the codebase matures.[^shared]

## Source Layout Highlights
- Core logic lives in `src/agent_logic/core_functions.py` with a skeletal `AgentCore` class awaiting fuller implementation, indicating where orchestration, scheduling, and integration hooks should converge.[^agentcore]
- The automated test suite (`tests/test_core_functions.py`) already validates the current `AgentCore.run` contract, anchoring future refactors to maintain backward compatibility.[^tests]
- Documentation is extensive under `docs/`, covering dashboards, GitHub Actions, database expectations, and OPORD directives that inform future structural growth.[^docs-overview]

## Tooling, Scripts, and Setup Assets
- Setup automation under `scripts/` outlines a multi-phase onboarding flow, from dependency validation through inter-agent connectivity checks, underscoring the repository's role as a hub for coordinating other agent deployments.[^local-setup]
- `setup.py` is prepared to package the agent with dependencies sourced from `requirements.txt`, which currently serves as a placeholder for pinning runtime libraries once components solidify.[^setup]

## Observations on Planned vs. Implemented Structure
- The system instructions describe an expanded module tree (automated tests, security testing, performance testing, reporting, and web UI directories) that are not yet present in the repository, highlighting a roadmap gap between planning artifacts and implemented code.[^system-structure]
- Aligning the live tree with the documented blueprint will require staged delivery of feature-focused packages (e.g., `automated_tests`, `security_testing`) accompanied by dependency declarations and instrumentation updates.
