# OPORD-PR-CYBR-TESTING-8

## 1. OPERATIONAL SUMMARY
The objective of this OPORD is to update the PR-CYBR-TESTING-AGENT’s files to facilitate the loading of users into an interactive terminal program. This will be achieved through executing a setup script that utilizes TMUX to create multiple terminal windows for enhanced user interaction.

## 2. SITUATION
Quality assurance through comprehensive testing is essential in ensuring the reliability and security of PR-CYBR's systems. Updates are required to enhance testing capabilities and streamline interactions within testing environments.

## 3. MISSION
The PR-CYBR-TESTING-AGENT is tasked with updating the following files:
- `src/main.py`
- `scripts/setup.sh`
- `setup.py`
- `tests/test-setup.py`
- `README.md`

These updates will ensure integration with `scripts/setup.sh` to deploy TMUX for creating interactive terminal windows as specified.

## 4. EXECUTION

### 4.A. CONCEPT OF OPERATIONS
The mission will primarily focus on enhancing testing capabilities for user interactions and system stability through the updated terminal setup.

### 4.B. TASKS
1. **File Updates**
   - Modify `src/main.py` to correctly trigger the testing setup script.
   - Adjust `scripts/setup.sh` to clone necessary repositories and configure TMUX windows.
   - Update `setup.py` for any dependencies required for automated testing frameworks.
   - Enhance `tests/test-setup.py` to validate the new functionalities introduced through the terminal setup.
   - Revise `README.md` to include updated instructions for using the new system.

2. **Implementation of TMUX**
   - Clone the aliases repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/cywf/aliases.git
     cd aliases
     cp bash_aliases /home/$USER/.bash_aliases
     source ~/.bashrc
     cd install-scripts && chmod +x tmux-install.sh
     ./tmux-install.sh
     tmux new -s pr-cybr
     ```
   - Create the following terminal windows:
     - **Window 1**: Show a welcome message, options, and a loading progress bar.
     - **Window 2**: Run `htop` for system performance monitoring.
     - **Window 3**: Utilize `tail -f` to observe logs created by `scripts/setup.sh`.
     - **Window 4**: Exhibit output of `ls -l` in the repository root.

## 5. ADMINISTRATION AND LOGISTICS
- Ensure all updates are documented and tracked through version control.
- Review testing functionalities with relevant stakeholders post-implementation.

## 6. COMMAND AND SIGNAL
- Provide regular updates through PR-CYBR’s communication channels.
- Ensure a clear understanding of new functionalities among all agents.

**This OPORD mandates the PR-CYBR-TESTING-AGENT to execute its responsibilities in alignment with PR-CYBR's quality assurance objectives.**
